## Product Description

Clever Smart Forex Software is an advanced trading tool developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to enhance your trading strategy by providing key features that help identify and analyze market structures, order blocks, fair value gaps, and premium and discount zones. 

This software is built using the MQL5 language, which is widely recognized and utilized in the forex trading community. It is a powerful and flexible language that allows for the development of custom indicators, scripts, and expert advisors.

## Key Features

### 1. Identifying and Highlighting Equal Highs and Lows

The `findEqualHighsAndLows()` function is responsible for identifying and highlighting equal highs and lows in the market structure. This feature helps traders identify potential areas of support and resistance, which are crucial for making informed trading decisions.

### 2. Identifying Order Blocks and their Internals

The `identifyOrderBlocks()` function is designed to identify order blocks and their internals. Order blocks are areas on a price chart where significant buying or selling activity has occurred. By analyzing these order blocks, traders can gain insights into market dynamics and potential future price movements.

### 3. Identifying High and Low Fair Value Gaps

The `identifyFairValueGaps()` function helps traders identify high and low fair value gaps. Fair value gaps occur when the current market price deviates significantly from its fair value. By identifying these gaps, traders can potentially capitalize on price corrections and profit from market inefficiencies.

### 4. Identifying Premium and Discount Zones

The `identifyPremiumAndDiscountZones()` function is responsible for identifying premium and discount zones in the market structure. These zones represent areas where the market is overbought or oversold, providing valuable information for traders looking to enter or exit positions.

## Execution

The main function `start()` executes the Clever Smart Forex Software by calling the individual functions to implement the key features described above. Once executed, the software will analyze the market structure, identify equal highs and lows, order blocks, fair value gaps, and premium and discount zones, and provide a logical conclusion.
